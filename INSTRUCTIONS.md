2. **Each task requires some fullstack change**.

   a. If you add new field(s) to the schema, you need to make sure that the change is backwards-compatible with the original version. Make sure you're also filtering your queries appropriately.

   b. **If you are adding create, update, or delete logic, the user MUST have some way to trigger this via the UI.**

3. Ask for help anytime if something doesn't make sense or you become stuck.
